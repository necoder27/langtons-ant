# langtons-ant

this is a simple visualization of langton's ant that i coded for fun. to make it a little more interesting i added two more colors and a function that allows the ant to move diagonally too. the spawn position of the ant is random and it warps around the window which creates really cool effects. the color scheme can be switched by specifying a theme with four colors and selecting it in the main function.
